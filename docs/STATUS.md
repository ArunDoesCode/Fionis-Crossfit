# Project status — pick up here

> Single entry point for "where are we and what's next". Updated by `/feature` (at phase changes and in
> every PR), `/status` (on demand) and `/wrap`. Humans: read this, then run `/status`.

**Updated:** 2026-10-03 · **Milestone:** member-records M1 reached — auth merged (#11) after Stream 0 (#10, M0); `member/` skipped for the member-records MVP
**Next action:** `claude --model opus "/feature member-records/setup"` in a new session from fresh `main`, and `/feature member-records/members` in a second session in parallel (M2; D-017) — each with its own `DATABASE_URL_TEST` database (e.g. `gym_setup_test`).

## Modules
| Module | Spec | Map | Code | Next step |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| member-records (assessment entry, overdue list, report card, gym progress, membership terms) | frozen v2: index + 10 sub-specs (data-model v2, auth v2) | current (Stream 0 + auth) | partial: Stream 0 (#10) + auth (#11) on `main` | C setup + B members (M2) → D, E, F (M3) → G (M4) |
| auth-members (login, invites, roles, permissions) | none | — | none | M1 — `/spec auth-members` |
| workouts (library, benchmarks, versions, timer config) | none | — | none | M1 |
| sessions (templates, schedule, lifecycle state machine, jobs) | none | — | none | M1 |
| attendance (QR check-in, manual add) | none | — | none | M1 |
| results (submit, validate, correct, audit, idempotency) | none | — | none | M1 |
| scoring-board (baseline, perf index, board, PR) | none | — | none | M2 |
| achievements (catalog, streaks, awards, revocation) | none | — | none | M2 |
| tv-feed (snapshot, SSE, outbox, heartbeat) | none | — | none | M3 |
| tv-scenes (ambient, gather, workout, live board, overlay, credits, lab) | none | — | none | M3 (several sub-specs) |
| member-app (today, check-in, result entry, history, progress, boards) | none | — | none | M4 |
| push (tokens, reminders, results-open) | none | — | none | M4 |
| membership-payments | none | — | none | after the pilot |

Legend — Code: none / schema only / partial / full. Tests per module: see each map's **Tests** table.

## Waiting on you
- [ ] `main` ruleset: add required checks `backend`, `frontend`, `fixtures`; "require branches to be up to date" on; "require deployments" off.
- [ ] Run the auth manual checklist `.pipeline/member-records-auth/checklist.md` (start with `cd backend && bun run bootstrap-admin`).
- [ ] Setup checklist (`docs/WORKFLOW.md` §Setup): create the GitHub repo, protect `main`, install `gh`.
- [ ] Confirm decisions D-002 (single repo, no shared packages) and D-004 (own auth + SSE, Supabase only as Postgres).
- [ ] Decide: member login by email OTP or password — settled in the `auth-members` interview.
