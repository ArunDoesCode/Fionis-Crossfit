# How project knowledge is organised (and how it scales)

`CLAUDE.md` cannot hold everything — it's loaded into every session, so every line costs context forever.
Knowledge is layered by **how often it's needed**; agents load the smallest layer that answers the question.

| Layer | File(s) | Loaded | Holds | Budget |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| L0 | root `CLAUDE.md` | every session | product, current milestone, the loop, rules that apply everywhere, **pointers** | ≤ 100 lines |
| L1 | `backend/CLAUDE.md`, `frontend/CLAUDE.md`, `member/CLAUDE.md` | when working in that package | tech conventions for the package | ≤ 150 lines each |
| L2 | package skills (`pagination-contract`, `client-data-state`, `tv-rendering`, `offline-writes` …) | when the task matches | detailed how-to for one kind of work | one topic each |
| L3 | `docs/modules/<module>.md` (**module map**, as-built) | before touching a module | where the code is, data model, API, flows, module gotchas, tests, history | 60–250 lines |
| L3 | `docs/specs/<module>.md` (spec, should-be) | before building/changing behaviour | states, rules `BR-*`, acceptance criteria | 150–400 lines |
| L4 | `docs/decisions.md`, GitHub Issues (backlog, UAT bugs), `docs/STATUS.md` | when deciding / planning / picking up | why, what's deferred, what's broken, where we are | append-only / tables |
| L5 | `.pipeline/<feature>/` | only by the coordinator of that feature | briefs, reports, findings, questions of one run | per run, archived |
| — | codegraph index (`.codegraph/`) + contract manifest | on demand | exact symbols, call paths, API shapes | generated |

## Where does a new learning go?
| The learning is about… | Put it in |
|---|---|
| one module (a trap in board ranking, a session status quirk) | that module's map → **Invariants & gotchas** |
| a business rule | the spec (via `/spec` / `/freeze` change path) |
| a convention for all backend (or all frontend) code | package `CLAUDE.md` — or the matching skill if it's detailed |
| a kind of task (lists, forms, endpoints) | the matching skill |
| a decision with a reason | `docs/decisions.md` |
| everything, every session (rare!) | root `CLAUDE.md` |
| your personal working style | Claude memory |

`/wrap` routes learnings using this table. Rule of thumb: **the narrower the scope, the deeper the layer.**

## How agents avoid re-exploring the codebase
1. **Start from the map, not the code.** Every pipeline agent reads `docs/modules/<module>.md` first.
2. **Only look at what changed.** The map records `last_verified_commit`. Explorer runs
   `git diff <sha>..HEAD --stat -- <paths in the map>` and reads only changed files.
3. **Targeted lookups.** For anything else, codegraph (`codegraph_explore` with a symbol name) instead of
   grep sweeps; the contract manifest (`contract:query`) instead of reading routes/controllers.
4. **Maps are updated in the same PR as the code.** `/feature` Phase 4 refreshes the map (new files,
   endpoints, gotchas, history row, new `last_verified_commit`), so the next run starts accurate.
5. **Resuming work** reads `docs/STATUS.md` → `.pipeline/<feature>/plan.md` → findings — no
   re-planning.

## When the codebase grows
- **New module** → `/map <module>` creates its map; add a row to `docs/STATUS.md`.
- **Map > 250 lines** → split by sub-area (`docs/modules/results/validation.md`, `…/corrections.md`) with `results.md` as index.
- **Spec > 400 lines** → split into sub-feature specs and run `/feature` once per sub-spec.
- **CLAUDE.md over budget** → move detail to a skill or module map, leave a one-line pointer. `/wrap`
  checks budgets.
- **Backlog** lives in GitHub Issues (filter by label); no file to split.
- **`.pipeline/` grows** → merged runs are history; agents only read the current feature's folder. Archive
  older than a milestone into `docs/history/` summaries if the folder gets noisy.
- **Stale maps** → `/map --stale` lists maps whose paths changed since `last_verified_commit` and refreshes
  them (cheap: Haiku explorer, diff-only).
